00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

00:08.080 --> 00:14.800
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

00:14.800 --> 00:20.360
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so

00:20.360 --> 00:24.240
conceived and so dedicated can long endure.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.760
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

00:26.760 --> 00:33.120
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here

00:33.120 --> 00:36.040
gave their lives that the nation might live.

00:36.040 --> 00:56.640
It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.
