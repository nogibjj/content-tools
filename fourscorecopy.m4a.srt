00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,800
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,360
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,240
conceived and so dedicated can long endure.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,760
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,120
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,040
gave their lives that the nation might live.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:56,640
It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.
